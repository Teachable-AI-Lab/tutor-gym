    I need your help solving this {domain_name} problem. This is the problem state:
    {state}

    I need you to give me the next action for this problem state. You are only only allowed to changed a field with 'locked' as False. I need your response in this format: field;action_type;value, where:
    1. field is name of the field. 
    2. action_type can either be either "PressButton" or "input change"
    3. The value is the value to enter that field.
    Avoid additional text.
