%(statement)%	"John has 7 siblings and he is the oldest, and 5/7 are brothers! Show this fraction on the number line."	A TV ratings company is trying to determine who is watching a certain TV show. They conduct a poll and find that 1/4 of the people that watch the show are less than 18 years old. Show 1/4 on the number line.	"Recall the previous problem; a TV ratings company determined that 1/4 of the people watching the show are less than 18 years old. Then, 3/4 of the people watching the show would be older than 18. Show 3/4 on the number line."	"Brad is the quarterback of his school's football team. In the first half of one game, he completed three of the six passes he threw, or 3/6 of his passes. Show this value on the number line. "	Jason became the next class president because 7/10 of the students in the school voted for him! Show this fraction on the number line.	"Jack is enjoying a certain song that is 6 minutes long, and he has been listening to it for 5 minutes now. That means he has listened to 5/6 of the song. Show this fraction on the number line."	A recent census in Brad's school just found out that it has more boys than girls! 3/5 of the students in Brad's school are boys. Show 3/5 on the number line and see that it is more than half.	"Sally's aunt has a small tomato garden in her backyard, and it consists of 8 tomato plants. One day, a hungry deer passed by and ate 2 of her tomato plants. Show how much of Sally's aunt's tomato garden is unharmed on the number line."	Cheryl and Leslie were bowling. It was the last frame and Cheryl needed to knock down five of the ten pins to win. Show the score Cheryl needed to get in order to win on the number line.	"Lisa is painting a small fence by the pond in her backyard. The fence is 7 feet long, and she has painted 5 feet so far. Show how much of the fence Lisa has painted on the number line. "	You have two packs of highlighters and each pack contains 5 highlighters. You let a friend borrow 9 of your highlighters. Show how much of your entire highlighter collection you let your friends borrow on the number line.	"Sarah parked her car at a parking meter. To park for 15 minutes, or 1/4 of an hour, it cost a quarter. Sarah had to park for 30 minutes or 2/4 of an hour. Show 2/4 on the number line."	"What if Sarah parked a bit longer at the same parking meter? This time, Sarah had to park for an hour and 30 minutes or 6/4 of an hour. Show 6/4 on the number line."	"Rick ordered two pizzas and invited a couple of friends over for dinner. The pizzas were each divided into six slices. Together Rick and his friends ate nine slices, or 9/6 of a pizza. Use the number line to show this fraction."	"Sometimes, it is easier to estimate fractions when they are in mixed number form. When you are estimating 13/8 on the line, you will have to count 13 parts, but try estimating its mixed number form, 1 and 5/8; you only have to estimate 5 parts after ""1""! Show where 1 and 5/8 lies on the number line."	"Sean's baseball team played against Barry's team. The two teams were tied after nine innings, so the game went into extra innings. Sean's team won the game in the tenth inning. Usually a game only lasts nine innings, but since they played a tenth, Sean and Barry's game lasted 10/9 as long as a normal game. Show 10/9 on the number line."	"Jamie is helping her parents bake a very large batch of muffins for a party tomorrow. Jamie's task is to fill the muffin tray with the muffin batter. Each muffin tray makes 12 muffins. Jamie filled one muffin tray completely, but could only fill 11 spaces of the second tray. This means she filled 1 and 11/12 muffin trays. Show this fraction on the number line."	"Every morning, Lili's mother prepares a pitcher of tomato juice for Lili and her sister. One morning, Lili's mother made the pitcher a bit too large; it completely filled Lili's cup, her sister's up, and the left over filled about 3/4 of a third cup. Show the number of cups of tomato juice Lili's mother prepared that morning on the number line."	"Katie has a huge collection of colorful pens; she has 33 of them! If she were to describe the pen collection in number of dozens, it would be 33/12, or 2 and 9/12 dozens. Show the number of dozens of pens on the number line."	Brandon had packs of gum that he shared with his friend. Each pack had five pieces. He gave Luke six pieces. Describe the number of packs of gum Brandon gave away and show the value on the number line.	What if Brandon shared more gum? Let's say each pack had five pieces and he gave his friends a total of 12 pieces. Describe the number of packs of gum Brandon gave away and show the value on the number line.	Eric had two weeks to finish a science project. He was able to finish it in only nine days. How would you describe the number of weeks it took him to finish the project? Show the fraction on the number line. 	"John has 9 bottles of water, and wishes to move them to bigger water bottles. Each larger water bottle can hold water from 4 smaller bottles. If he moves water from all of the smaller water bottles, how many of the larger water bottles would be filled? Show the amount on the number line."
