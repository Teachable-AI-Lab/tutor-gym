%(statement)%	Taneesha's age is 10 years less than her brother Ben's age. Let's compare their ages.	Chaz and Nikki are standing in a long line to buy rock concert tickets. Nikki is 8 feet ahead of Chaz in the line. Let's compare Chaz's distance to Nikki's distance from the front of the line.	Large pizzas cost $9 each at the Pizza Emporium. Let's figure out how much the total cost is based on the number of pizzas you order.	"Two Pittsburgh skyscrapers were built at the same rate.  As they rose, the height of the Acme Building was always 3 stories more than the height of the Stilt Tower, since work was started on the Acme Building first.  Let's compare the height of the Acme Building to the height of the Stilt Tower."	"Tom and Huck are painting their backyard fences. They are painting at the same rate, but Huck started later and is 5 feet behind Tom. Let's compare the distance Tom has painted to the distance Huck has painted."	"A carton of eggs contains 12 eggs. If you know the number of eggs that you have, then you can figure out the number of cartons that you will need for them."	"Aaron, Benita, Cathy, and Derek pooled their money to buy a bunch of raffle tickets for a club fundraiser. They agreed that if any of the tickets were the winner, they would split the money evenly between them. If you know the amount of money they win then you can figure out the amount of each person's share."	"On average, the temperature in Los Angeles is 16 degrees higher than the temperature in San Francisco. Let's compare the temperature in Los Angeles to the temperature in San Francisco."	An airliner travels from Cincinnati to Cleveland 5 times faster than a bus. Let's compare the distance an airliner travels with the distance a bus travels in the same amount of time.
