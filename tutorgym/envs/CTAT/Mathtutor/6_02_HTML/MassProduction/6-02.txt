%(problem_statement)%	"Wendy wants to host a barbeque in her backyard. To prepare for how many veggie burgers she will need to buy, she uses a formula depending on how many people are going to show up."	The website CDs-R-Us sells music CDs. You can buy as many CDs as you want each time you order for $8 a cd plus a $12 shipping and handling charge. The company uses the following formula to calculate the cost of an order:	"Andy borrowed $30 from his parents to buy the new Space Rider video game. To pay them back, Andy decides to walk dogs for his neighbors during the summer, charging them $15 per dog walked. He hopes the summer job will also give him some extra spending money. To keep track of how much money he has to spend on himself, Andy uses the following formula:"	"The class end of semester celebration is coming up and Alice wants to bring in pumpkin cookies as gifts for her classmates and her teacher, Miss Bird. Alice and her mom bake enough cookies so that Alice can give six cookies to as many friends as she wants and twelve cookies to Miss Bird. The morning of the party, Alice decides how many cookies she needs to take by using the following formula:"	"Danny wants to buy his mom a bottle of her favorite perfume for her birthday, but he only has $14 in his piggy bank. Danny's parents give him an allowance of $5 every week, so he decides to save money until he can afford to buy the expensive perfume. To calculate how much money he will have after saving, Danny uses the following formula:"	"Wonder World, a local amusement park, just opened for the season and Emily's class is taking an all-day field trip there. Emily's parents buy her enough tickets in advance to give her best friend 20 tickets and go on as many rides as she wants. It takes 4 tickets to ride one ride. Emily keeps track of how many tickets she has used up at the park by using the following formula:"	"There are 10 students in Mr. Whistler's advanced art class and they have decided to enter the city-wide art competition. Not only will it be fun to work together on a big project, but a big check goes to the winning group. Each student contributes $5 for supplies for the competition. The students use the following formula to determine how much they will individually receive from the winnings."	"Susie has a bad habit of spending all of the money her parents give her for her allowance, and now she wants to try to save some of it. She gathers up all of the money she has, counts that it is $20, and puts it in a piggy bank. She decides to put 1/5 of her allowance into the bank over the next year, keeping the rest to spend on herself (old habits die hard!). Curious about how much money she will have to buy toys and candy at the end of the year, Susie uses the following formula to calculate how much she will have saved."	"Mark and his 3 friends go to a local baseball game. They each paid $25 for a ticket to the game. When they enter the ball park, they are randomly selected to participate in a trivia challenge in which they can win a grand prize. Mark uses the following formula to figure out how much money he can win if they split the grand prize."	"Beth's Sunshine Cadet troop is selling boxes of chocolate for $10 per box. The money raised from the sale will go into the troop's charity fund, which already contains $200, to be given to the local children's hospital. Beth offers to calculate how much money the troop has after the chocolate sale is over. She uses the following formula:"	"Bobby has been collecting baseball cards for as long as he can remember and now he has 500 cards. That's more than anyone he knows! Because his collection is so large, Bobby decides to share any cards he gets for his birthday with his two brothers. To keep a count of the number of cards in his ever-growing collection, Bobby uses the following formula:"
%(formula1)%	Let g = the number of guests that show up	Let x = the number of CDs you order	Let d = the number of dogs Andy has walked	Let f = the number of friends receiving cookies	Let w = the number of weeks Danny has been saving	Let r = the rides Emily has ridden	Let p = the prize money for wining the art competition	Let a = the allowance Susie gets over the year	Let p = the grand prize for the trivia challenge	Let b = the boxes of chocolates sold	Let c = the cards Bobby receives for his birthday
