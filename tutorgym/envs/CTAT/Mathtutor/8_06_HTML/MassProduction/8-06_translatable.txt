%(problemtext)%	Danny and the Algebraics are recording their first demo album. They plan to send 15 CDs to record companies to try to land a recording contract. They are wondering how many additional CDs they should make. They have a fixed budget of $1000 and it costs $2.50 to make a CD. They use this formula to see how much they will have left if they make a different numbers of CDs. <br/><br/>Let C = the number of CDs they make after the initial 15 CDs.<br/><br/>The amount of money they will have left = 1000-2.50(C+15)<br/><br/>(1) How much money is left if they make 85 additional CDs?<br/><br/>(2) How much money is left if they make 125 additional CDs?<br/><br/>(3) How much money is left if they make 250 additional CDs?<br/><br/>(4) How much money is left if they make 385 additional CDs?
