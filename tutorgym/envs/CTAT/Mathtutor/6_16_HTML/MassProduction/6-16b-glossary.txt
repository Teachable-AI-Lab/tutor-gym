Both RO and LF can be used as the base; they are BOTH perpendicular to the height. In this problem, RO is chosen. On the next problem, you can choose your own!"	"JKLM is a parallelogram. Using this information, solve the following questions."	"In Hawaii, there is a hut called ""Pu'uhonua O Honaunau"". It means ""The Place of Refuge of Honaunau."" This was the home of the ruling chief, as well as a place where people who had violated sacred laws could seek forgiveness and safety form the other villagers."	"Two parallelograms you below are the same parallelogram, it is just that one is rotated clock wise 90 degrees from the other. Practice using different heights and base to calculate the area with the parallelogram SPIN!"	"There is a land shaped like a parallelogram, and you are gathering information about it with a help of a partner. You measured Parallelogram %(geoName)%'s both of the heights, but your lazy parter only measured one base. "	"SKW is a triangle. KE is perpendicular to SE. Using the information provided, solve the following question."	"EVO forms a triangle as shown. MO and EV are parallel to each other. That means MV is perpendicular to both MO and EV. Using the information provided, solve the following question."	"%(geoName)% is a parallelogram. Using the information provided, fill in the table below completely. "	Parallelogram MILK and Parallelogram CUKI look different but they have the same area. 	"FROG is a parallelogram. Two heights are marked with dotted lines. 'Base #1' is perpendicular to 'Height #1', and 'Base #2' is perpendicular to 'Height #2'. "	"Ki'I pohaku is the Hawaiian word for petroglyph - an ancient rock carving. The carving above can be found in Waikoloa, Hawaii. The body of the individual forms a triangle."	"SALT is a parallelogram. Using this information, solve the following questions."	RHOM is a very special parallelogram called a Rhombus. It is a parallelogram where all 4 of its sides have the same length!
