%(statement)%	"You work at a dog kennel. When a dog comes to the kennel, he gets his own fenced run. The area of a run for a small dog should be 6 square meters. Dogs like to have long runs, so you need to decide which of the following widths will give the runs the longest length."	"At the same dog kennel you work, they use larger fenced run for larger dogs;  they should have an area of 10 square meters. Dogs like to have long runs, so you need to decide which of the following widths will give the runs the longest length. "	You are making a flag for the school play. The flag needs to have an area of 3 square yards. You can buy fabric in different widths. Figure out how long the fabric piece would need to be for the different widths given. Which width will give you the longest flag?	You are designing a walkway from the garage to your back porch. You have enough cement to cover 8.25 square meters. To the right are some possible widths for the walkway. What width would give you the longest walkway?	Your mom is planting her flower garden for next year. She bought enough tulip bulbs to cover 12 square feet and she is choosing between three different spots for planting them. Figure out how long each garden plot would be if she uses all her bulbs in one plot. Which width will give her the longest plot?	You are making a sandbox. You have enough sand to cover an area of 13 square yards. Which of the following widths for the sandbox will give you the shortest length for the sandbox?	"Heather is class president and is in charge of making a new bulletin board every month. For December, the bulletin board has to be 5 sq. yards in order for her to fit all of the pictures that her class has drawn. Figure out which measurements will give Heather the longest bulletin board?"	"Suzie is weaving an afghan for her grandmother's birthday.
