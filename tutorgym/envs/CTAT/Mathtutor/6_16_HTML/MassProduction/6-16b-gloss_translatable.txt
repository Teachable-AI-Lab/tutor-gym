%(graphic)%	16ROFL
%(statement)%	In a parallelogram, ANY side can be the "base" as long as it is perpendicular to the "height"! In the parallelogram ROFL below, OP represents the altitude (or height). Both RO and LF can be used as the base; they are BOTH perpendicular to the height. In this problem, RO is chosen. On the next problem, you can choose your own!
%(size)%	3
%(question1)%	(1) If the measure of segment RO = 40 cm and the measure of segment OP is 12 cm, find the Area of the Paralleogram.
%(question2)%	(2) Find length of the height of Parallelogram ROFL if you know that Area = 72 sq. cm, RL = 9 cm, and LF = 10  cm.
%(question3)%	(3) Find the length of LF, the base of Parallelogram ROFL if you know that Area = 45 sq. cm., OF = 5 cm, and OP = 3 cm.

%(question1)%	(1) As marked on graph A, SN = 3 ft and SP = 8ft. But only one height is known: IJ = 5.5. What is the area of SPIN?

%(question3)%	Note: Graph A and B are the same parallelogram, so answering question 1 and 2 should give out a certain identical value. Find out what it is!

%(question1)%	(1) Two heights of parallelogram LAND you measured are: AC = 20 yards and BD = 16 yards. Your partner measured just one base: AN = 10 yards. What is LAND's area?

%(question3)%	Note: Parallelogram LAND in question 1 and 2 does NOT have the same measurement! This is not like the previous problem, where the measurement stayed the same for question 1 and 2.

%(Ans2a_hint1)%	Enter the length of the parallelogram's base here. Not sure which segment is the base? What is the label of the base segment?
%(Ans2a_hint2)%	The diagram label under Base of RHOM is HO. Unfortunately, the length of HO is not given in the question statement. But you can figure it out! Remember that RHOM is a rhombus. 
%(Ans2a_hint3)%	Rhombus is a special parallelogram where all 4 of the sides have the same length. This means, if you know the length of 1 side, you will know the lengths of all 4 sides! 
%(Ans2a_hint4)%	Since RH = 24 ft, rest of the sides of RHOM are also 24 feet long. Enter 24 into the highlighted area.
%(Ans2b_hint1)%	Enter the length of the parallelogram's height here. Not sure which segment that is? What is the label of the height segment?
%(Ans2b_hint2)%	Take a look at the diagram label of this column, or under "Height of RHOM". What is the name or the label of the segment that represents the height?
%(Ans2b_hint3)%	The label under "Height of RHOM" is NM. Do you remember how long the segment NM is? Read the problem statement again if you forgot. 
%(Ans2b_hint4)%	The height (NM) is 17 feet long.
%(Ans2c_hint1)%	A perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all the sides of a geometry.

%(Ans2d_hint2)%	Open the glossary and search for "Area - Parallelogram". 
%(Ans2d_hint3)%	The area (A) of the parallelogram RHOM can be found using the formula: A = b * h, which means Area = "base" * "height". What is the length of the base? What is the length of the height?
