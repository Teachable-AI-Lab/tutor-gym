%(statement)%	You work at a dog kennel. When a dog comes to the kennel, he gets his own fenced run. The area of a run for a small dog should be 6 square meters. Dogs like to have long runs, so you need to decide which of the following widths will give the runs the longest length.
%(question1)%	(1) What is the length of the run when the width is 1 meter?
%(question2)%	(2) You increase the width to 1.5 m, what will the length be?
%(question3)%	(3) You decrease the width to 0.5 m, what will the length be?
%(heading1)%	area of the run
