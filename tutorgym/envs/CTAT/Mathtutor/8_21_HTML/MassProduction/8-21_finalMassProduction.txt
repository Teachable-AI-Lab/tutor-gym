"Stacy, Kate, and Erika are playing soccer. Stacy has the ball. She and Kate are parallel to the goal."	Moesha found a treasure map in her grandparents' attic. It tells her to start at a cave. 	Triangle ABC is a right triangle. Angle C represents the right angle (90 degree angle).	"Sam decided to walk in the park for an exercise today. She parked her car at point ""A"" and began walking."

"	A boat is drifting on the surface of the ocean with its anchor down so that it will not drift too far. 	Today you decide to drive around the neighborhood in which you would like to rent an apartment. 	Let's say you drive down to see the apartment but the length of the streets were different.

So instead of kicking it to Kate, Stacy decides to kick it right toward Erika. Find the distance the soccer ball traveled if Stacy and Kate are 14 feet away from each other, while Kate is 22.5 feet directly in front of the goalie, Erika."	"From the cave, she should walk 63 yards due west until she reaches a palm three. Then, she should walk north for 60 yards and dig for the treasure. This is 123 yards of walk; it's long! But Moesha is smart; she decided to use Pythagorean theorem to figure out the distance of the short cut; she will walk straight from the cave to the treasure!"

You are wondering how high the airplane is in the sky when you see another airplane pass above your house."	The captain knows the length of the chain that connects to the anchor; it is 58 foot. He wants to know the maximum distance the boat can drift with this length of the chain. He made a simple diagram of the boat and its chain when it has drifted as much as possible. 	"You are currently at your friend's house, point 'B'. You drive down Cochran Boulevard, and then you turn left on to Elm Street until you reach the apartment you wanted to see, at point 'A'.
