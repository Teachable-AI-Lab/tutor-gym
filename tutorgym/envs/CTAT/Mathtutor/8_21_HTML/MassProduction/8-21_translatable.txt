%(story1)%	Sam visited the park again for some exercise. She parked her car at point "A" and began walking.
%(story2)%	Starting from point "A", Sam walked 'c' units due east. After she reached a huge tree (point "B"), she changed her direction and walked 'a' units due north. When she reached point "C", it began to rain! So she ran to her car in a southwest direction, from point "C" to "A" to get into her car. Answer the following questions by completing the table.
%(question1)%	If she ran 5 kilometers to get back to her car and walked 4 kilometers due east when she was walking, how many kilometers did she walk due north?
