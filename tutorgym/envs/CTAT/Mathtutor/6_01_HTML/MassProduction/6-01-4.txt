%(statement)%	"In the last Olympic Games, the United States received 35 more gold medals than silver medals."	Patrick went outside during a meteor shower and saw 7 shooting stars per hour.	Sarah is growing tomato plants on her apartment's balcony. Every day she finds 3 ripe tomatoes.	"Jared is participating in a reading program at the local library. For every 5 books he reads, he gets a star next to his name on the bulletin board."	"At the local convenience store, you can buy soda in one of two sizes: The Small Sip or the Big Drink. The Big drink has 12 more ounces than the Small Sip."	"At the local movie theater, the evening show costs $2.50 more than the afternoon show."	Cara has a cherry tree in her backyard and wants to make some cherry pies. Each pie takes 6 cups of cherries.	You went to the grocery store to buy bottles of the new green colored ketchup. Each bottle costs $2.00 and you had a coupon of $1.25 off your grocery bill.	Speedy Spiro is driving across Utah at a speed of 50 miles per hour. He has already driven 200 miles.	"Cheyenne has $20 in her piggy bank right now. She wants a new bike, so she will save $5 a week until she has enough."	Mrs. Jenkins has 24 glasses in the cupboard. Her family uses 3 glasses a day. If no one runs the dishwasher:	"It costs $10 to get into Wonder World Amusement Park. In addition, you must buy books of tickets, which cost $7 a piece."	"Brady's Little League team is ranked first in the city, with a total of 25 points. For every game they win, the team will get another 5 points for their ranking."
%(question1)%	"1. If the U.S. team received 15 silver medals, how many gold medals did it win? "	1. How many shooting stars did he see in 2 hours?	1. How long will it be before Sarah has 6 tomatoes?	1. How many stars will Jared have if he reads 10 books?	"1. If the Big Drink has 20 ounces, how many ounces does the Small Sip contain?"	"1. If the evening show costs $7.50, how much does the afternoon show cost?"	"1. If she picks 12 cups of cherries, how many pies can she make?"	"1. If you bought 3 bottles, how much money would you owe?"	"1. After 3 more hours, how far has Spiro driven altogether?"	1. How much money will Cheyenne have in 3 weeks?	1. How many glasses will be left in 2 days?	"1. If you bought 3 books of tickets, how much did you spend altogether?"	"1. If Brady's team wins another 3 games, how may total points will they have?"
%(question2)%	"2. If the U.S. team received 30 silver medals, how many gold medals did it win?"	2. How many shooting stars did he see in 3 hours?	2. How long will it be before she has 12 tomatoes?	2. How many stars will Jared have if he reads 35 books?	"2. If the Big Drink has 30 ounces, how many ounces does the Small Sip contain?"	"2. If the evening show costs $9.00, how much does the afternoon show cost?"	"2. If she picks 24 cups of cherries, how many pies can she make?"	"2. If you bought 5 bottles, how much money would you owe?"	"2. After 5 more hours, how far has Spiro driven altogether"	2. How much money will Cheyenne have in 6 weeks?	2. How many glasses will be left in 5 days?	"2. If you bought 5 books, how much did you spend altogether?"	"2. If Brady's team wins another 8 games, how may total points will they have?"
%(question3)%			3. How long will it be before she has 21 tomatoes?	3. How many stars will Jared have if he reads 50 books?							3. How many glasses will be left in 8 days?		
%(explanation)%	The number of gold medals is based on the number of silver medals received.	The number of shooting stars he saw is based on the number of hours he watched.	The number of days is based on the number of tomatoes found.	The number of stars is based on the number of books read.	The size of the Small Sip is based on the size of the Big Drink.	The cost of the afternoon show is based on the cost of the evening show.	The number of cherry pies is based on the number of cups of cherries picked.				The number of clean glasses left is based on the number of days.
