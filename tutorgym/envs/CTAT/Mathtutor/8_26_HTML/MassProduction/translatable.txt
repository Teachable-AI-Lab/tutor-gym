%(q1_hint1)%	In order to solve this question, you need to figure out which line(s) in the graph it is referring to.
%(q1_hint2)%	The question is asking about the shortest player. What line in the graph represents the shortest height?
%(q1_hint3)%	The shortest player is equal to the minimum value represented in the graph. Locate the minimum and identify the corresponding value on the bottom scale.
%(q1_hint4)%	The minimum is 66. Please enter '66' in the highlighted field.
	
%(q2_hint1)%	In order to solve this question, you need to figure out which line(s) in the graph it is referring to.
%(q2_hint2)%	The question is asking you to identify a percentage from the graph. If 75% of players are at least a certain height, we know that 25% of the players are less than that height. What line in the graph separates the bottom 25% from the upper 75%? 
%(q2_hint3)%	The left end of the box represents the 1st quartile. That is the line that separates the shorter 25% from the taller 75%. What number on the scale matches that mark?
%(q2_hint4)%	The left of the box marks 25%. The left lines up with 68. Please enter '68' in the highlighted field.
	
%(q3_hint1)%	In order to solve this question, you need to figure out which line(s) in the graph it is referring to.
%(q3_hint2)%	The question is asking you to identify a percentage of the graph. What line marks the median of the players' heights?
%(q3_hint3)%	Saying that '50% of the players are at least' some height means that exactly 50% of the players are taller than some height. Which line marks half of the distribution?
%(q3_hint4)%	The line in the middle of the box marks half of the distribution. 50% of the values are above 71. Please enter '71' in the highlighted field.
