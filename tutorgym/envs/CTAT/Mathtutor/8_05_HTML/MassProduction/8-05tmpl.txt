%(problem_statement)%	"You are interested in buying some shirts from a mail order company. The shirts cost $15 each, with a flat shipping and handling charge of $5.00. For the grand opening celebration, if you buy more than 3 shirts, the first three shirts will be free! You have not decided on how many shirts to buy, but using x and y as your variables, you can represent this situation with this equation:"	"You are interested in buying some shirts from a mail order company. The shirts cost $20 each, with a flat shipping and handling charge of $6.00. For the grand opening celebration, if you buy more than 2 shirts, the first two shirts will be free! You have not decided on how many shirts to buy, but using x and y as your variables, you can represent this situation with this equation:"	"The National Music Club charges new members $2 for an introductory set of 5 CDs and charges $12 for each additional CD. Using X and Y as your variables, you can represent this situation with the function:"	"Pauline is designing an apartment building. The first two floors of the building will provide 15000 square feet of space for stores. Each additional story in the building will provide 6650 square feet of space for apartments. Pauline uses this equation to relate the number of stories in the new building to its total space in square feet. Using X and Y as your variables, you can represent this situation with the function:"	"Hilda and Vern are carpeting their living room and the stairs leading up from the living room. The floor space in the living room is 900 square feet, but they have no idea how many square feet of carpet will be needed for the stairs. Their new carpet costs $10.99 per square foot and there is an installation fee of $75. Hilda and Vern came up with this formula to compute their total costs, depending on how much carpet is needed for the stairs. "	"Chet took out a $25,000 loan to open a surfboard shop. He makes a $500 profit on each surfboard he sells. So far Chet has sold 15 surfboards. He wrote the following equation to figure out how many additional surfboards he needs to sell to pay off his loan. Using X and Y as your variables, you can represent this situation with this function:"	"Antoine has signed up with the GetConnected internet company. He pays a fixed fee of $15 per month for internet access. The first hour of connect time each month is free, and he pays $2 for each additional hour. Antoine wrote this equation to compute how much it will cost him for different total amounts of connect time in a month. Using X and Y as your variablees, you can represent this situation with the function:"	"The Pine Mountain resort is expanding. Currently, the resort has the main lodge that accommodates 50 guests, and 10 already existing cabins accommodate 6 guests. The manager is planning to build more cabins that also hold 6 guests. She uses this equation to think about the relationship between the number of new cabins and the total number of guests that can be accommodated. Using X and Y as your variables, you can represent this situation with the function:"	"On the Professional Women's Tennis Circuit, a player's rank is determined by a point system. Each player starts the year with some initial points based on her ranking the year before, and earns 200 points for each win during the year. Marian Williams started the year with 1800 points and had won 4 tournaments by the end of March. This formula shows how many points she will earn by the end of this year, depending on how many tournament she wins between April and December."	"Julie is catering a big party and each guest will be served one mini-pizza for dinner. The initial fee is $50 and that includes the first 10 pizzas. Julie charges $3 for each additional pizza. Julie uses this formula to calculate her bill: Using X and Y as your variables, you can represent this situation with the function:"	"Lizzy the butterfly scientists planted 5000 butterfly eggs in a park to help their survival; only 2 out of 100 eggs successfully becomes butterflies in the wild! This year, 150 new adult butterflies in the same park are reported. Lizzy is wondering how many of those butterflies flew in from a different place. Depending on the number of wild eggs that already existed, Lizzy can figure out how many of the butterflies came from far away using the following equation:"
