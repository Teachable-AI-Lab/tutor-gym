%(problem_statement)%	The Smiths are going on vacation in July. They are choosing between boating at a lake or hiking in the mountains and wonder how hot it gets in each place. This box-and-whisker graph shows the daily high temperatures at the lake and in the mountains.	Two supermarkets in the area are selling pumpkins for Halloween. The ShopWell supermarket gets its pumpkins from a single local farm. The Apex supermarket gets its pumpkins from many small farms in the area. These box-and-whisker graphs show the size (the height) of individual pumpkins that are available at the two stores.
