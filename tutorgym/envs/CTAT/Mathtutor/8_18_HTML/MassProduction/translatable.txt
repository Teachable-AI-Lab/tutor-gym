%(D)%	Ryan is a computer programmer who creates math tutors for a living. Right now, Ryan is building a tutor for his little brother, A.J. Ryan created a number of different lessons that he could put into the tutor, but A.J. only wants to do a sequence of 3 lessons at a time. Because Ryan wants to make sure A.J. learns as much as possible, he cannot make a tutor if any of the lessons are used more than once. Please help Ryan figure out the number of possible tutors he could build for his brother.

%(Q4C1H1)%	What do you already know from the question?
%(Q4C1H2)%	A given value in the question represents the number of runners on the team. Because none of these runners have been given a position in the relay race, there are this many possible first runners for the lineup. Please type this given value into the correct place on the table.
%(Q4C1H3)%	Please enter '5' in the highlighted field.
%(Q4C2H1)%	What is the number of possible second runners?
%(Q4C2H2)%	One of the runners has already been chosen as the first possible runner in the relay race, so the number of possible second runners is one less than the number of possible first runners.
%(Q4C2H3)%	Please enter '4' in the highlighted field.
%(Q4C3H1)%	What is the number of possible third runners?
%(Q4C3H2)%	Both the first and second runners for the relay race have been chosen, and because the runners cannot appear more than once in the lineup, the number of possible third runners is two less than the number of possible first runners.
