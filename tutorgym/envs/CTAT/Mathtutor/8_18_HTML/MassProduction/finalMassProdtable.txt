Please help Thom figure out how many different CDs he can make."	"Ryan is a computer programmer who creates math tutors for a living. Right now, Ryan is building a tutor for his little brother, A.J. Ryan created a number of different lessons that he could put into the tutor, but A.J. only wants to do a sequence of 3 lessons at a time. Because Ryan wants to make sure A.J. learns as much as possible, he cannot make a tutor if any of the lessons are used more than once. Please help Ryan figure out the number of possible tutors he could build for his brother."	"Liam is visiting Seoul, the capital of South Korea, for 4 days. In Seoul, there are a number of major palaces, restored from the days when South Korea had a monarchy.

Please help Liam plan his schedule of visits. "	"Mrs. Hemingway is putting together a collection of her students' short stories to send to parents and teachers.
