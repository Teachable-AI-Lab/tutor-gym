The known lengths are marked in the diagram. Find the area of the entire region."	The diagram shown on the left is composed of a square and three semicircles.	You are cutting out a right triangle out of a square ABCD.			
%(question1)%	Fill each rows on the table completely knowing only one information for the each questions. 	Segment OA is circle O's radius. The table below will guide you through the steps of finding the area (A) of the circle. Use it to answer the following questions. 	Segment OB is circle O's radius. The table below will guide you through the steps of finding the area (A) and the circumference (C) of the circle. 	"(1) If a side of SQUA is 10 cm, what is its area and perimeter?"	"You know how to find an area of a circle using its radius, but can you go backwards? Use the table labels as a guide to help you find the radius from the value of area for circle O!"	"You can also do the same thing with the circumference; you can find the circumference using the radius, and you can find the radius using the circumference. "	Fill the table below completely using the information given in each questions. Use the table's heading as a guide when solving for the radius.	(1) Fill in the entire row knowing only that circle O's diameter is 12 inches long.	(1) Fill the entire row only knowing circle Q's diameter: 22 mm.	"The rope, which is represented as segment OD in the diagram, is 10 feet long.  However, Chris wants to place a fence around Cocoa's tree so that Cocoa does not need to be tied with a rope anymore. "	Jeff's circular baby pool does not have a cover to keep the water clean when it is not in use. Jeff wants to get a cover that will fit the pool perfectly.	Shape B is a semicircle. It is made by cutting a full circle (shape A) in half. 	"Shape C is formed by adding two shapes together, shape A and shape B."	The diagram above is composed of a square and a semicircle. It is the same shape you saw in the previous problem.	Shape C is formed by subtracting the circle (shape B) from the square (shape A).	A lawn sprinkler spins 360 degrees and has a 6 ft spray. It's placed in a rectangular lawn that is 14 feet by 18 feet. 	The diagram you see on the left side is a quarter of a circle. It came from a full circle that has a 7 cm radius. It was cut into 4 pieces to make this quarter-circle.	The diagram you see on the left side is composed of a square and 4 quarter circles. 	"Circle O has a radius, OE, of 1.5 inches. It is enclosed in Square ABCD. Square ABCD, like all squares, has four sides of equal length. In this diagram, the length of AB = 3 inches. "	"You are cutting out a biggest circle possible from a square-shaped paper. Find the area of the paper left over after you cut out the circle, only knowing the length of a side of the square."	"The diagram above is composed of a rectangle and two semicircles. If the base of the rectangle, HT = 13 cm, and the height of the rectangle, MH = 6 cm, find the area of the entire region. "		Find the area of the entire region only knowing that the length of one of the sides of the square is 10 centimeters! 	Point F and E are the midpoints of the sides of the square. This means the right triangle (colored in yellow) has a base and a height that is half of the length of the square.	"Jack is cutting out pieces of wood that will be the tail of his airplane model. Right now, he is trying to figure out the area of the resulting tail, so that he will know how much paint to purchase."	The figure shown on the left is the result of a rectangle after a semicircle has been cut out from it. Rectangle ABCD has the dimension marked in the diagram.	Anna is making an ice-cream-shaped poster for decorating her uncle's new ice cream shop. She drew the diagram you see on the left to plan out the size of the paper ice creams.
%(question2)%	"(1) Let's say you only know that circle O's radius is 3 cm. What are the circle's diameter, area, and perimeter?"	"(1) If the radius is 2 inches, what is the area of circle O?"	"(1) If the radius is 10 inches, what is the area of the circle O?"	"(2) If you know that ABCD's area is 25 sq. cm, what is the length of one of its side? And what is its perimeter?"	(1) Lets review: find the area of circle O if the radius is 3 cm.	(1) Find the circumference of the circle if the diameter (segment CR) is 14 feet. Here is a hint: 1/2 of a diameter gives you 1 radius.	(1) Fill in the entire row knowing only that circle O's radius is 12 cm.	(2) Fill the entire row knowing only that circle O's area is 200.96 square inches. 	(2) Fill the entire row only knowing circle Q's area: 144*pi sq. mm. 	Help Chris figure out the length of the chain-link fencing he needs to buy for the fence to cover the same area Cocoa was able to roam while being tied.	"When purchasing the baby pool, Jeff was told that the pool has an area of 153.86 square feet. To make a cover for the pool he will need to know the diameter. "	"If the length of the diameter of the whole circle(shape A) is 20 centimeters, find the semicircle's area (shape B), and the length of the arc CD, seen on shape B. "	"Shape A is a square ABCD, and shape B is a semicircle. Find the area of the entire region (as shown by shape C), only knowing one thing: segment AB of ABCD is 6 inches."	"If the length of one of the sides of the square is 10 centimeters, find the area of the entire region. "	Shape A is a square where one of its side is 9 ft. Shape B is a circle where its radius is 2 ft.	Find the area of the lawn that will NOT be watered if the owner forgets to move the sprinkler for rest of the day. 	"Using that information, find the perimeter of the quarter circle."	"E, F, G, H are mid-points of the sides of square ABCD. If the length of a side of ABCD is 20 cm."	Use this information to find the area of the red-shaded region. 	(1) What is the area of the left over paper if a side the square is 12 inches.	      	      		(1) Find the area of the red area only knowing that the length of a side of the square ABCD is 10 cm.	"Here is what Jack knows: the length, FD, is 12 inches long, and the width, CD, is 7 inches long. The length of segment AB is the half of the width, and the length of segment FE is exactly 1/4 of the width."	"Using what is given, find the area and the perimeter of the purple shape."	Help Anna figure out the area of the poster so that we will know how much paper she will need.
%(question3)%	"(2) Let's say you only know that circle O's area is 314 sq. cm. What are the circle's radius, diameter, and perimeter?"	"(2) Practice finding the area using a different radius, 5 inches. What is the area of circle O this time?"	"(2) If the radius is 6 inches, what is the circumference of the circle?"	"(3) If you know that SQUA's perimeter is 24 cm, what is the length of one of its side? And what is its area?"	"(2) Now, lets go backwards: find the radius of circle O if its area is 81* pi sq. cm."	"(2) Now, lets go backwards: find the radius of the circle if its circumference is 16 * pi feet."	(2) Fill in the entire row knowing only that circle O's area is 25 * pi sq. cm.	(3) Fill the entire row knowing only that circle O's circumference is 12.56 inches long.	"(3) Fill the entire row, this time, knowing only that circle Q's circumference is 30*pi mm."	"Also, determine the area Cocoa can freely roam around within the fence. Use an approximate value of pi, 3.14, when calculating."	Help Jeff calculate the diameter of the baby pool. 	     	      	       	"Find the area of the final region, shape C."	      	Be careful: A perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all the sides of a geometry. So the perimeter of the quarter circle is not just the arc CD!	"Using the information above, find the area of the green area. "	      	(2)  What is the area of the left over paper if the circle's radius is 2.5 inches.	      	      	      	(2) Find the area of the red area only knowing that the length of FC is 6 cm.	"Jack is taking out the part of the wood that is marked with ""X"". Help Jack find the area of the the tail piece."
