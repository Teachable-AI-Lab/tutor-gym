The table below will guide you through the steps of finding the area (A) of the circle. Use it to answer the following questions. 	Segment OB is circle O's radius. The table below will guide you through the steps of finding the area (A) and the circumference (C) of the circle. 	"1. If a side of SQUA is 10 cm, what is its area and perimeter?"	"You know how to find an area of a circle using its radius, but can you go backwards? Use the table labels as a guide to help you find the radius from the value of area for circle O!"

"	Jeff's circular baby pool does not have a cover to keep the water clean when it is not in use. Jeff wants to get a cover that will fit the pool perfectly.	Shape B is a semicircle. It is made by cutting a full circle (shape A) in half. 	"Shape C is formed by adding two shapes together, shape A and shape B."	The diagram above is composed of a square and a semicircle. It is the same shape you saw in the previous problem.	Shape C is formed by subtracting the circle (shape B) from the square (shape A).	A lawn sprinkler spins 360 degrees and has a 6 ft spray. It's placed in a rectangular lawn that is 14 feet by 18 feet. 	The diagram you see on the left side is a quarter of a circle. It came from a full circle that has a 7 cm radius. It was cut into 4 pieces to make this quarter-circle.	The diagram you see on the left side is composed of a square and 4 quarter circles. 	"Circle O has a radius, OE, of 1.5 inches.
