%(D)%	A pencil company has just finished making 1200 pencils. They're getting ready to pack them into boxes. If they use 200 boxes, how many pencils will be in each box?	In the old days, people measured water depths in "shots" of chain. If the ocean is 3000 feet deep, and it takes 20 "shots" to reach the bottom, how long is a "shot" of chain?	Supergirl has been really busy lately. In the past 30 days, she's saved 210 people from villains and disasters. How many people, on average, did she save each day?	After a canned food drive, your school has collected 56,000 cans of food! The school will give an equal number of cans to each of 8000 homeless families. How many cans will each family be given?	Your class raised $60 to buy candy bars to give out in Halloween. If your class bought 120 candy bars that each cost the same amount, how much did each candy bar cost?	Jackie is in charge of her school's Winter Wonderland dance. She has to make sure that the DJ brings enough music. If each song is 2.5 minutes, how many songs can the DJ play in an hour?	Dan has just entered a bike race. It takes Dan 4.8 minutes to complete one mile on his bicycle. Figure out how many miles Dan can cycle in 96 minutes.	Ashley is hanging posters of her favorite band, the Juliana Theory, on her wall. Her wall is 14 feet in width, and she is hanging one row of posters along the entire wall.
